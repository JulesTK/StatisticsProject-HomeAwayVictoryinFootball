# StatisticsProject-HomeAwayVictoryinFootball

During our Master 1 in Mathematical Engineering, we had a course in Mathematical Statistics, with a project to do. Passionate about sports, especially soccer, we decided to perform different types of Statistical Tests around the following problem: "Is there a significant difference in the number of home wins compared to the number of away wins in soccer?
We were a group of 3 students, composed of BOGLIETTO Lucas, PAOLI Dorian and myself. 

It is a fairly simple project, where we simply applied principles seen in class, such as the Student and Chi^2 tests. 
We used data from the Data Hub site:

We took the data of the 5 major European championships, namely England, Spain, Germany, France, Italy, over the last 6 seasons from 2018/2019 (i.e. before the 2019/2020 season and the cut-off related to COVID-19). 
We made an oral report with the support of a powerpoint presentation and our R program presented here, all written in French.
